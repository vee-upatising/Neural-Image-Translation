* ## Requirements
  * Python 3
  * Keras
  * Tensorflow == ```2.5.0```
  * Sklearn
  * Skimage
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * PIL

* ## Documentation
  * ## [Cycle GAN Training](https://nbviewer.org/github/vee-upatising/Neural-Image-Translation/blob/main/Cycle%20GAN%20Training.ipynb)
      * This script is used to define the Cycle GAN class, train the two Generative Adversarial Networks, generate samples, and save the model at every epoch interval.

      * ### User Specified Parameters:
          * ```batch_size```: Integer representing how many images to train per batch.
          * ```dataset_dimensions```: Tuple defining dimensions to resize the dataset to during preprocessing.
          * ```dataset_name ```: String representing name of [Tensorflow Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cycle_gan) (e.g. ```cycle_gan/apple2orange```). Only needs to be defined if ```preprocessed_dataset``` is ```True```.
          * ```input_img_size```: Tuple defining the size of the random crops to be used during training.
          * ```input_path```: File path pointing to folder containing input dataset. Only needs to be defined if ```preprocessed_dataset``` is ```False```.
          * ```interval```: Integer representing how many epochs between saving your model.
          * ```model_save_path```: File path pointing to the folder where you want to save to model as well as generated samples.
          * ```output_path```: File path pointing to folder containing output dataset. Only needs to be defined if ```preprocessed_dataset``` is ```False```.
          * ```pretrain```: Boolean flag for if you want to train starting with a pretrained model.
          * ```pretrained_model_path```: File path pointing to pretrained H5 model if pretraining mode is enabled.
          * ```preprocessed_dataset```: Boolean flag for if you want to train with a preprocessed [Tensorflow Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cycle_gan).
          * ```training_epochs```: Integer representing how many epochs to train the model.

  * ## [Cycle GAN Inference](https://nbviewer.org/github/vee-upatising/Neural-Image-Translation/blob/main/Cycle%20GAN%20Inference.ipynb)
      * This script is used to test Cycle GAN models and plot results.

      * ### User Specified Parameters:
          * ```dataset_dimensions```: Tuple defining dimensions to resize the dataset to during preprocessing.
          * ```dataset_name ```: String representing name of [Tensorflow Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cycle_gan) (e.g. ```cycle_gan/horse2zebra```). Only needs to be defined if ```preprocessed_dataset``` is ```True```.
          * ```input_path```: File path pointing to folder containing input dataset. Only needs to be defined if ```preprocessed_dataset``` is ```False```.
          * ```model_path```: File path pointing to H5 model saved during training process.
          * ```output_path```: File path pointing to folder containing output dataset. Only needs to be defined if ```preprocessed_dataset``` is ```False```.
          * ```preprocessed_dataset```: Boolean flag for if you want to train with a preprocessed [Tensorflow Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cycle_gan).
          * ```results_save_path```: File path pointing to folder where generated results are saved.
